name: profibus_dp_driver_for_toit
description: This package supports the Profibus-DP fieldbus protocol. The package
  allows communication with a passive Profibus-DP enabled device. Certain features
  are implemented at the moment, such as setting up a slave to achieve the data exchange
  state. See the [dp.toit](src/dp.toit) and [dp_master.toit](src/dp_master.toit) files
  to view features and services implemented. The package cannot be used in a multi-master
  network, as master token sharing has not been implemented yet.
