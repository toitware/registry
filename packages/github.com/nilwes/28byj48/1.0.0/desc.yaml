description: This example demonstrates bidirectional operation of a 28BYJ-48, using
  a VMA401 - ULN2003 interface board to drive the stepper. The 28BYJ-48 motor is a
  4-phase, 8-beat motor, geared down by a factor of 64. One bipolar winding is on
  motor pins 1 & 3 and the other on motor pins 2 & 4.
